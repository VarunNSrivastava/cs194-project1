# cs194-project1

Structure:
  - lib/: contains some of the original images (just the jpegs). 
  - out/: contains my output images as well as some accompanying text files (for my reference).
  - README.md: this file
  - index.html: website
  - main.py: the entire python program. It can be run as-is, so long as the "lib/" directory is populated and the "out/" directory exists.
