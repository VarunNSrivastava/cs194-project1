Structure:
```
  lib/: contains some of the original images (just the jpegs). 
  out/: contains my output images as well as some accompanying text files (for my reference).
  - README.md: this file
  - index.html: website
  - main.py: the entire python program. It can be run as-is, so long as the "lib/" directory is populated and the "out/" directory exists. 
```
